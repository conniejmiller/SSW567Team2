# Assignment 1 Description

## Project Objectives:

To form teams of 2-3 students who will work together on most assignments
To install and experiment with a set of development and unit test tools that your team can use throughout the course
To create an initial program to be used in later assignments.
To learn how to write up assignments and turn them in.
To get to know your teammates and start figuring out how to work together.

## Part 1 - Form teams of 2-3 members
Most of the class assignments will be done as a team and all the members of the team will submit a single deliverable.   All members of the team will receive the same score for each assignment.   You will be asked to evaluate the contributions of your team members at the end of the semester.  

NOTE: It will be very helpful if at least one member of your team is able to write simple Python or Java code.

The deliverable for Part 1 of this assignment is to define your teams/groups in Canvas.

## Part 2 - Choose, install, explore and use development tools:   
It maybe challenging to get the tools working, and you may think this is a waste of your time.Testers frequently get code and tools that only partially work. Learning how to make things work (like tools) is an important part of becoming an effective tester. So although you may struggle here, it is good experience and you will get better at it.

We will be doing some hands-on testing of software programs throughout the course.   Your team needs to choose a set of tools to help you to write and test some simple programs and test more complex programs.    You may choose either Python or Java.    If no one on your team knows Python or Java, then I recommend that you use Python 3 or Python 2.7.   Python is relatively easy to read and learn and it is required in SSW 540.  Many students may already know Java so your team may choose either language.  We will be doing relatively little coding in this class so don't be too concerned if you're not a Python or Java expert, but you may want to try to include at least one team member who can write Python or Java code.

Regardless of the programming language your team chooses, you'll need to choose, install, and experiment with the following tools:

A development environment that allows you to explore, write, execute, and debug source code.  Your development environment may be as simple as a text editor and a shell or you may want to choose a more powerful development environment.   Each team may choose the development environment they prefer to use.  For Python, I recommend Spyder for Python which is included in the Anaconda Python release (Links to an external site.). Eclipse (Links to an external site.) is a very popular Integrated Development Environment for Java.  Again, you may choose an IDE other than Spyder or Eclipse, but you will need to create, run, and test a simple program to complete the assignment this week.

Along with your development environment, you'll need to choose a unit test tool that your team will use for testing software.   I recommend UnitTest (Links to an external site.) if your team is using Python or JUnit (Links to an external site.) if you team is using Java.  Both UnitTest and JUnit use the same underlying framework for testing so the code for both is very similar and differs only that one supports Python and the other supports Java.

We'll be using GitHub (Links to an external site.) as our configuration management system. I recommend that you start using GitHub in this assignment to manage changes to your code.

Each team must choose and install your programming and development environment, along with the corresponding unit test tool.    You should play around with the tools, use them, and understand what they can do. This should help you work together as a team.    Previous students spent a lot of time finding and loading tools, which really is not the point. Instead, I want you to pick a tool and get started using the tool.  Each team will demonstrate their proficiency with the tools in Part 3 of this week's assignment.  There are many tutorials for Python's UnitTest (Links to an external site.) and Java's JUnit (Links to an external site.) that will help you to get started.    

## Part 3: Use your tools on a simple program to identify different types of triangles.
You are to write a program, execute, and do preliminary testing on a simple program.  
Requirements: “Write a function classifyTriangle() that takes three  parameters: a, b, and c. The three parameters represent the lengths of the sides of a triangle. The function returns a string that specifies whether the triangle is scalene, isosceles, or equilateral, and whether it is a right triangle as well.”

Hint:  Write a function called classifyTriangle(a, b, c) where a, b, and c are the lengths of the sides of the triangles.   You may either allow the user to enter values that you pass to classifyTriangle() or your "main" routine can just invoke classifyTriangle() with values.   This approach allows you to easily invoke classifyTriangle() from your test framework.

You will not be graded on how well you write the program, but try to do a decent job.  You may want to include a few bugs in your program to demonstrate that your test script is working properly and is able to find problems.

## Assignment Deliverables:
Each team should submit one response for this assignment using the format described below.

Deliverable 1: Each team must upload a file with Python or Java source code for your classifyTriangle solution to Canvas.  The file should include the source code used to solve the problem and the test cases for the code.

Deliverable 2: Each team must deliver a screen shot or file to show the input and output of running the program on at least 5 different sets of input.

Deliverable 3: Each team must deliver the output of your test script showing the results of at least 5 test cases.  You may choose to combine the  program output and the test results in a single file.

Deliverable 4: Each team must deliver a description of their assignment in the format specified below, including your choice of programming language, development environment and test tools.
