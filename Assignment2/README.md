# Week 2:Project Objectives

Identify appropriate test strategies for the Triangle problem

Create and run a test set that you feel adequately tests the program logic in the classifyTriangle() function in buggyTriangle.pyPreview the documentView in a new window and upload your initial findings in a formal test report described below.

Fix all of the bugs you find in the classifyTriangle() function in buggyTriangle.pyPreview the documentView in a new window. Don't simply replace my logic with your logic from Assignment 1.  Test teams typically don't have the luxury of rewriting code from scratch and instead must fix what's delivered to the test team.   
To Do:

buggyTriangle.pyPreview the documentView in a new window contains an implementation of the classifyTriangle() function with a few bugs.  

Download and review the buggyTriangle.pyPreview the documentView in a new window file which includes the classifyTriangle() function implemented in Python.  You may choose either to use the Python code or you may replicate the Python logic in the language of your choice, e.g. Java.   If you choose to use some other language, you can just copy your code from Assignment 1 BUT replace your classifyTriangle() logic with the logic from buggyTriangle.py.

Create a set of test cases for the Triangle problem that adequately tests the classifyTriangle() function to find problems.

Run your test set against the classifyTriangle() function and upload a test report in the format specified below.  This report shows the results of testing the initial classifyTriangle() implementation.

After you've completed defining your test set and running it against the buggy classifyTriangle() function, update the logic in classifytTriangle() to fix all of the logic bugs you found by code inspection and with your test cases.

Run the same test set on your improved classifyTriangle() function and upload a test report on your improved logic 

## Deliverables:

1. Include a written test report in your assignment summary with the results of running your test set against the buggy implementation of classifyTriangle in buggyTriangle.pyPreview the documentView in a new window using  the following format:  

Test ID Input | Expected Results | Actual Result | Pass or Fail
---|---|---|---
   |   |   | 

2. Upload a copy of your source code for your improved classifyTriangle()

3. Upload a copy of your test set.  Your test set may be part of the same source code file with classifyTriangle() or a separate file.

4. Upload a screen dump or output file of running your test set on the improved classifyTriangle() function

5. Include a written test report in your assignment summary with the results of running your test set against the improved implementation of classifyTriangle using  the following format:  

Test ID Input | Expected Results | Actual Result | Pass or Fail
---|---|---|---
   |   |   | 
                 
6.  Your assignment summary should include a matrix as shown below in the summary results along with a description of the strategy you used to decide when you had a sufficient number of test cases.
